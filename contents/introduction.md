## What is this?

The **Tech Interview Handbook** contains carefully curated content to help you ace your next technical interview with a focus on algorithms. While there are a ton of interview resources on the internet, the best ones are either not free, or they do not cover the complete interview process, usually only focusing on algorithms. Tech Interview Handbook goes straight to the point and tells you the minimum you need to know to pass your technical interviews.

Over 500,000 people have benefitted from this handbook!

## Why do I want this?

This repository has **practical** content that covers all phases of a technical interview, from applying for a job to passing the interviews to offer negotiation. Technically competent candidates might still find the non-technical content helpful as well.

## Who is this for?

Whether you are a beginner to technical interviews or a seasoned engineer who has not been on the other side of the interviewing table in a while and want to get back into the game, the Tech Interview Handbook has got you covered.

If you are a busy engineer like most people are, this resource is for you. Nobody has time to do hundreds of LeetCode questions, and the good news is that you don't need to do that many to actually get the job at FAANG! We have hundreds of LeetCode questions and distilled the best questions to practice.
