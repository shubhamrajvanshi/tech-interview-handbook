## What is this?

No one has time to do a few hundred LeetCode questions. Here are _free and curated_ technical interview preparation materials for busy engineers, brought to you by the author of the [Blind 75 List](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU).

Besides the usual algorithm questions, other **awesome** stuff includes:

- [How to prepare](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-round-overview) for coding interviews
- [Interview Cheatsheet](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/cheatsheet) - Straight-to-the-point Do's and Don'ts
- [Algorithm tips and the best practice questions](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/introduction) categorized by topic
- [Interview formats](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/interview-formats) of the top tech companies
- [Behavioral questions](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/behavioral-questions) asked by the top tech companies
- [Good questions to ask your interviewers](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/questions-to-ask) at the end of the interviews
- [Helpful resume tips](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/resume) to get your resume noticed and the Do's and Don'ts
- [Front-End Interview preparation](https://frontendinterviewhandbook.com)

Help from you in contributing content would be very much appreciated!

## Why do I want this?

This repository has _practical_ content that covers all phases of a technical interview, from applying for a job to passing the interviews to offer negotiation. Technically competent candidates might still find the non-technical content helpful as well.

## Who is this for?

Anybody who wants to land a job at a tech company but is new to technical interviews, seasoned engineers who have not been on the other side of the interviewing table in a while and want to get back into the game, or anyone who wants to be better at technical interviewing.

## How is this repository different?

There are many awesome books like [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) and interview-related repositories out there on GitHub, what makes this repository different? The difference is that many existing interview repositories contain mainly links to external resources whereas this repository contains top-quality curated content directly for your consumption.

Also, existing resources focus mainly on algorithm questions and lack coverage for more domain-specific and non-technical questions. This handbook aims to cover content beyond the typical algorithmic coding questions. üòé

## Looking for Front End content?

Front-end-related content has been moved to a separate website - [Front End Interview Handbook](https://frontendinterviewhandbook.com).

## Looking for System Design content?

We're still working on System Design content. In the meanwhile, check out Educative's [Grokking the System Design Interview course](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview?aff=x23W), which in our opinion is one of the most useful resources for getting started on system design interviews preparation.

## Contents

A [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) website has been created to provide a better reading experience. Check out the website [here](https://techinterviewhandbook.org)!

## Related

If you are interested in how data structures are implemented, check out [Lago](https://github.com/yangshun/lago), a Data Structures and Algorithms library for JavaScript. It is pretty much still WIP but I intend to make it into a library that can be used in production and also a reference resource for revising Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Contributing

There are no formal contributing guidelines at the moment as things are still in flux and we might find a better approach to structure content as we go along. You are welcome to contribute whatever you think will be helpful to fellow engineers. If you would like to contribute content for different domains, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request and we can discuss further.
